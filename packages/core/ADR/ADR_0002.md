# ADR-0002: Remove `I` prefix from TypeScript interface names

## Status

Accepted – 2025-06-15

## Context

Historically, some parts of the codebase adopted the **`I`-prefix** convention for TypeScript interfaces (e.g. `IEvent`, `IHandler`).
This style originates mainly from languages like C# where the prefix helps distinguish interfaces from classes at a glance.

In TypeScript, however, the distinction is already syntactically clear and the prefix offers **no additional semantic value**:

- The declaration keyword (`interface` vs `class`) makes the kind immediately obvious when reading the source.
- Interfaces are erased at runtime, so the prefix cannot be used for reflection or dependency-injection purposes.
- The leading `I` clutters auto-completion lists, grouping unrelated identifiers together and hiding more descriptive beginnings of the name.
- When an interface evolves into an abstract/base class (or vice-versa) the prefix forces a breaking rename instead of allowing a mechanical keyword change.

Modern TypeScript style guides (Microsoft, Google, AirBnB, etc.) therefore advise **against** the `I`-prefix. ESLint's `@typescript-eslint/naming-convention` rule also discourages it by default.

## Decision

1. **Stop introducing new `I`-prefixed interfaces.**
2. **Gradually rename existing occurrences** inside `packages/core` from `<IName>` to `<Name>` (e.g. `IEvent` → `Event`).
3. **Enforce the rule via ESLint** by enabling `@typescript-eslint/naming-convention` with a pattern that forbids the prefix.

## Consequences

- code is shorter and easier to read; the first character is always meaningful.
- Migration churn: renaming will touch many import statements.

## Follow-ups

- Add an ESLint rule in the shared config.
