# Event Driven Architecture / BullMQ

This package provides BullMQ integration for the [@event-driven-architecture/core](https://github.com/artandrey/event-driven) framework, enabling robust, queue-based event-driven processing in TypeScript applications.

## Key Principles

- **Event Agnostic Handlers:** Your application layer (event handlers) remains agnostic to the underlying message queue. All BullMQ-specific details are encapsulated in the event class.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Define queue, job options, and event names in the event class. Handlers only care about the event payload.

## Installation

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @event-driven-architecture/bullmq bullmq @event-driven-architecture/core

# Using yarn
yarn add @event-driven-architecture/bullmq bullmq @event-driven-architecture/core

# Using pnpm
pnpm add @event-driven-architecture/bullmq bullmq @event-driven-architecture/core

# Using bun
bun add @event-driven-architecture/bullmq bullmq @event-driven-architecture/core
```

> **Note:** `bullmq` and `@event-driven-architecture/core` are peer dependencies and must be installed in your project.

---

## Defining Events

All BullMQ-specific details (queue name, event name, job options) are defined in the event class. This keeps handlers and the rest of your application agnostic to the transport layer.

```typescript
import { BullMqEvent } from '@event-driven-architecture/bullmq';

const QUEUE_NAME = 'user-queue';

export class UserCreatedEvent extends BullMqEvent<{ userId: string }> {
  constructor(payload: { userId: string }) {
    super({
      queueName: QUEUE_NAME,
      name: 'user-created',
      jobOptions: { attempts: 3 },
      payload,
    });
  }
}
```

---

## Creating Event Handlers

Handlers are completely decoupled from BullMQ. They only depend on the event type and its payload:

```typescript
import { IEventHandler } from '@event-driven-architecture/core';

import { UserCreatedEvent } from './events/user-created.event';

export class UserCreatedHandler implements IEventHandler<UserCreatedEvent> {
  handle(event: UserCreatedEvent) {
    // Business logic, unaware of MQ details
    console.log('User created:', event.payload.userId);
  }
}
```

---

## Registering Queues and Handlers

Queues still need to be registered explicitly, but **events are now discovered automatically from your handler signatures**.  
Use the `HandlesBullMq` helper to bind an event class to its handler; the consumer service will take care of registering the event class. No manual `eventsRegisterService.register(...)` calls are required anymore.

```typescript
import {
  EventsRegisterService,
  HandlesBullMq,
  QueueRegisterService,
  WorkerRegisterService,
  WorkerService,
} from '@event-driven-architecture/bullmq';
import { BaseHandlerRegister } from '@event-driven-architecture/core';
import { Queue } from 'bullmq';

import { UserCreatedEvent } from './events/user-created.event';
import { UserCreatedHandler } from './handlers/user-created.handler';

// 1  Create the required register services
const eventsRegisterService = new EventsRegisterService();
const queueRegisterService = new QueueRegisterService();
const handlerRegisterService = new BaseHandlerRegister();
const workerRegisterService = new WorkerRegisterService();
const workerService = new WorkerService(workerRegisterService);

// 2  Register your BullMQ queue instance
const userQueue = new Queue('user-queue', { connection: { host: 'localhost', port: 6379 } });
queueRegisterService.add(userQueue);

// 3  Bind the handler to the event
handlerRegisterService.addHandler(HandlesBullMq(UserCreatedEvent), new UserCreatedHandler());
```

## Publishing Events

You can publish events using either atomic or bulk strategies. Both are event-agnostic from the handler's perspective.

### Atomic vs Bulk Publishing

- **AtomicBullMqEventPublisher**: Adds each event/job to the queue individually. If one job fails, others still succeed. Use this for reliability when partial success is acceptable.
- **BulkBullMqEventPublisher**: Uses BullMQ's `addBulk` for efficiency. All jobs are added in a single operation, but if one fails, all fail. Use this for high-throughput scenarios where atomicity is not critical.

#### Example: Atomic Publishing

```typescript
import { AtomicBullMqEventPublisher } from '@event-driven-architecture/bullmq';

const eventPublisher = new AtomicBullMqEventPublisher(queueRegisterService);
const event = new UserCreatedEvent({ userId: '123' });
eventPublisher.publish(event);
```

#### Example: Bulk Publishing

```typescript
import { BulkBullMqEventPublisher } from '@event-driven-architecture/bullmq';

const bulkPublisher = new BulkBullMqEventPublisher(queueRegisterService);
bulkPublisher.publishAll([new UserCreatedEvent({ userId: '1' }), new UserCreatedEvent({ userId: '2' })]);
```

## Consuming Events

The consumer wires together three things:

1. A **Worker** per queue (created via `WorkerService.createWorker`). Workers are stored inside `WorkerRegisterService`, keyed by queue name.
2. The **QueueRegisterService** so the consumer can resolve the underlying `Queue` object when forwarding context to handlers.
3. The **EventsRegisterService / HandlerRegisterService** pair that lets the consumer map incoming jobs to the right event class and handler.

```typescript
import {
  BullMqEventConsumerService,
  QueueRegisterService,
  WorkerRegisterService,
  WorkerService,
} from '@event-driven-architecture/bullmq';
import { IEventBus } from '@event-driven-architecture/core';
import { Queue } from 'bullmq';

const workerRegisterService = new WorkerRegisterService();
const workerService = new WorkerService(workerRegisterService);
const handlerRegisterService = new BaseHandlerRegister();

// Queue registration
const queueRegisterService = new QueueRegisterService();
const userQueue = new Queue('user-queue', { connection: { host: 'localhost', port: 6379 } });
queueRegisterService.add(userQueue);

const consumerOptions = [
  {
    queueName: 'user-queue',
    // Any valid BullMQ WorkerOptions may go here (concurrency, connection, etc.)
    workerOptions: { connection: { host: 'localhost', port: 6379 } },
  },
];

const consumer = new BullMqEventConsumerService(
  workerRegisterService,
  queueRegisterService,
  eventsRegisterService,
  consumerOptions,
  workerService,
  eventBus,
  handlerRegisterService,
);

consumer.init(); // Spawns the workers and starts listening for jobs
```

---

## Handler Context

When an event is consumed, your handler can receive additional context (such as the BullMQ job, worker, and queue) if you define your handler to accept it:

```typescript
import { BullMqHandlerContext } from '@event-driven-architecture/bullmq';
import { IEventHandler } from '@event-driven-architecture/core';

import { UserCreatedEvent } from './events/user-created.event';

export class UserCreatedHandler implements IEventHandler<UserCreatedEvent, BullMqHandlerContext> {
  handle(event: UserCreatedEvent, context: BullMqHandlerContext) {
    console.log('Job ID:', context.job.id);
    // ...
  }
}
```

---

## Flow Job Processing

BullMQ supports "flow jobs"â€”hierarchies of jobs with parent/child relationships. This package provides a way to define, publish, and consume such flows using the `BullMqFlowEvent` class.

> **Note:** Sub-events (children) may also be instances of `BullMqFlowEvent`, allowing for deeply nested flow hierarchies.

### Defining Flow Events

Always use named interfaces for event payloads to ensure type safety and clarity.

```typescript
import { BullMqEvent, BullMqFlowEvent } from '@event-driven-architecture/bullmq';

const MAIN_QUEUE = 'main-queue';
const SUB_QUEUE = 'sub-queue';

interface SubEventPayload {
  sub: string;
}

interface FlowEventPayload {
  main: string;
  sub: string;
}

class SubEvent extends BullMqEvent<SubEventPayload> {
  constructor(payload: SubEventPayload) {
    super({
      queueName: SUB_QUEUE,
      name: 'sub-event',
      jobOptions: { attempts: 3 },
      payload,
    });
  }
}

class FlowEvent extends BullMqFlowEvent<FlowEventPayload> {
  constructor(payload: FlowEventPayload) {
    super({
      queueName: MAIN_QUEUE,
      name: 'flow-event',
      jobOptions: { attempts: 3 },
      payload,
      children: [new SubEvent({ sub: payload.sub })],
    });
  }
}
```

#### Example: Nested Flow Events

```typescript
interface SubFlowEventPayload {
  sub: string;
}

class SubFlowEvent extends BullMqFlowEvent<SubFlowEventPayload> {
  constructor(payload: SubFlowEventPayload) {
    super({
      queueName: SUB_QUEUE,
      name: 'sub-flow-event',
      jobOptions: { attempts: 3 },
      payload,
    });
  }
}

class MainFlowEvent extends BullMqFlowEvent<FlowEventPayload> {
  constructor(payload: FlowEventPayload) {
    super({
      queueName: MAIN_QUEUE,
      name: 'main-flow-event',
      jobOptions: { attempts: 3 },
      payload,
      children: [new SubFlowEvent({ sub: payload.sub })],
    });
  }
}
```

### Publishing Flow Events

To publish a flow event, use a publisher (atomic or bulk) and provide a `FlowRegisterService`:

```typescript
import { AtomicBullMqEventPublisher, FlowRegisterService } from '@event-driven-architecture/bullmq';
import { FlowProducer } from 'bullmq';

const flowRegisterService = new FlowRegisterService();
flowRegisterService.addSingleton(new FlowProducer({ connection: { host: 'localhost', port: 6379 } }));

const publisher = new AtomicBullMqEventPublisher(queueRegisterService, flowRegisterService);
publisher.publish(new FlowEvent({ main: 'main', sub: 'sub' }));
```

### Consuming Flow Events

When a flow event is consumed, only the parent event's payload is deserialized by default. **Children are not automatically fetched or deserialized for performance reasons.** If you need to access children, you must fetch them manually from BullMQ using the job's ID or other metadata.

This design ensures that handlers remain event-agnostic and only deal with the event payload unless they explicitly need to process children.

#### Example: Handler for a Flow Event

```typescript
import { BullMqHandlerContext } from '@event-driven-architecture/bullmq';
import { IEventHandler } from '@event-driven-architecture/core';

import { FlowEvent } from './events/flow-event';

export class FlowEventHandler implements IEventHandler<FlowEvent, BullMqHandlerContext> {
  async handle(event: FlowEvent, context: BullMqHandlerContext) {}
}
```

### Why Children Are Not Fetched by Default

Fetching children for every flow job can be expensive and unnecessary if your handler logic does not require them. By default, `event.$children` is `null`.
